    <p class="main-description"><em>Our Last Days of Letterpress</em> is a set of nine posters proclaiming that time is running out. The posters are designed to highlight the value of letterpress technology and encourage workshops to thrive.</p>
    <p class="main-description">The process of printing each poster was a labour of love; each poster design had to run through the press a minimum of three times, each poster was printed in a batch of 30. Ink was mixed by hand, countless cans of white spirit were used. There are no carbon copies, all of which makes them special.</p>
